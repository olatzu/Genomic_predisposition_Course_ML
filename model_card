# ðŸ§¬ Model Card: Genomic Disorder Prediction (XGBoost)

## Model Details

- **Model Name**: Genomic Disorder Classifier
- **Model Type**: Multi-class classification
- **Algorithm**: XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)
- **Framework**: Python (XGBoost + Scikit-learn)
- **Version**: 1.0
- **Author**: Olatz Mompeo Masachs
- **Date**: August 2025

This model predicts the presence of various genetic disorders based on clinical and family-related features. 
It uses XGBoost, selected after testing Random Forest, which failed to capture the relevance of some inherited features. 
XGBoost offered better recall and interpretability, especially in identifying interactions such as those between `Genes_Mother_Side`, `Inherited_Father`, and `Patient_Age`.

## Intended Use

- **Primary use case**: Early screening support tool for genetic disorder risk.
- **Users**: Medical data scientists, genetic researchers, healthcare AI developers.
- **Not intended for**: Automated diagnosis or clinical deployment without expert oversight.

---

## Inputs and Outputs

- **Inputs**:
  - Patient demographics (e.g., `Patient_Age`, `Gender`)
  - Inherited features (`Genes_Mother_Side`, `Inherited_Father`)
  - Binary clinical test indicators
  - All categorical features were label-encoded and scaled

- **Output**:
  - Predicted disorder class label (multi-class)
  - Optionally: probability distribution across classes

---

## Training Data

- **Source**: Data collected and compiled by the author for this project
- **Size**: 2230 x 27
- **Features**: Combination of binary, categorical, and continuous values
- **Label**: Target variable representing one of several genetic disorders

### Preprocessing:
- Categorical features were label-encoded
- Numerical features were scaled (standard)
- **SMOTENC** was used to oversample underrepresented classes, accounting for mixed feature types

---

## Evaluation Metrics

- **Primary**:
  - Macro F1-score
  - Class-wise recall (important for minimizing false negatives in rare classes)

- **Secondary**:
  - Accuracy
  - **Confusion matrix** used for diagnostic analysis

> ROC AUC was not included in evaluation, as the focus was on categorical outcomes and per-class sensitivity.

---

## Interpretability

- **SHAP values** were used to explain predictions and identify key interactions
- `Genes_Mother_Side` and `Inherited_Father` were recovered as important predictors
- SHAP interaction plots revealed multi-feature dependencies, improving trust in model outputs
- Random Forest was discarded due to its failure to highlight clinically meaningful features

---

## Ethical Considerations

- **Bias**: Dataset may reflect feature or label imbalances despite use of SMOTENC
- **Misclassification Risk**: Model may underperform on unseen or real-world patient populations
- **Responsibility**: Designed as a research/educational model â€” not for real-world clinical deployment

---

## Limitations

- Limited generalizability beyond the project dataset
- Dependent on properly scaled and encoded input data
- Interpretability tools (e.g., SHAP) are available but require user literacy in ML
